# Composite Design Pattern

It means object inside object.<br>

Example:
File system: inside directory, there can be list of files, or list of directories and this goes on.

This pattern has listing the file system as a problem in it so this is also a solution on how to list files in file system. <br>
This pattern also has an implementation of calculator in it.
